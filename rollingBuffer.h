/*
 A simple rolling Buffer that is designed for use in audio aplications that either syncronize reading a writing e.g a delay or phaser effect, or that ensure that there is only one thread reading and one writing at any time. e.g filling a buffer of audio data to be used for visualisation such as a spectogram or oscilloscope in a GUI.
 
 One must remember if using this that the write point is allowed to overtake the read point in this design
    and may cause unexpected behavior and nont continuos reads of data if read and write are not
    synchronised and if the read_chunk or read_value functions are being used.
