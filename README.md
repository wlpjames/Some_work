# Some_work

Some short example of some work that I have done in C++.

## messages.h :: 
A template function to help comunicate between GUI components and DSP classes, an array of which could act as a pythonesque dict.

## rollingBuffer.h :: 
A simple rolling buffer to be used in tasks that ensure sycronous reading and writting of data.

## oscillator ::
A header and cpp file that defines the main oscilator used in some of my audio work. This is designed to be used in a modular settings deals with aliasing quite badly, this has been improved in later verions.
