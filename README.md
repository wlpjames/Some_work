# Some_work

Some short example of some work that I have done

messages.h :: a template function to help comunicate between GUI components and DSP classes

rollingBuffer.h :: A simple rolling buffer to be used in tasks that ensure sycronous reading and writting of data.


oscillator:
   A header and cpp file that defines the main oscilator used in some of my audio work. This is designed to be used in a modular settings deals with aliasing quite badly, this has been improved in later verions.
